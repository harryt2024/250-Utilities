# 250 Utilities is a web application designed to provide easy to access applications to a RAFAC Squadron in the United Kingdom. 

For the purposes of the security I am required to inform all readers that this is a very early beta which is not yet designed for full production use. You may use aspects of the program for your own use but not for commercial. 

For your information the prisma config was made using AI due to lack of experience with the platform, no observed bugs or anything as of yet but it is still to play for per say.
